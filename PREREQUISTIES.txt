================== PREREQUISTIES=================

Required Python Version:
Python 3.9 (as you mentioned earlier — PyAudio works reliably on 3.7–3.9)

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Open your terminal/command prompt and run these commands one by one:
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit wikipedia pyjokes requests feedparser

Step 2: Install PyAudio (The Tricky One)
Since you're on Python 3.9, this should work:
Windows (most common):
pip install pyaudio

Step 3: System Requirements

Working microphone (built-in or external) — test it in Windows Voice Recorder or system settings
Speakers or headphones — for the assistant to speak back
Internet connection — required for:
Speech recognition (Google API)
Playing songs on YouTube
Wikipedia lookup
Weather and news
Opening websites

Step 4: Optional (But Recommended)

Install a good font for better UI look (Segoe UI is default on Windows)
Allow microphone access in your system privacy settings

Final Check Before Running
After installing everything, test imports in Python:

import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
import pywhatkit
import wikipedia
import pyjokes
import feedparser
import requests
import tkinter  # Comes built-in
print("All libraries imported successfully!")
